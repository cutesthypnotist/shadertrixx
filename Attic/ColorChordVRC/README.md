# ColorChord VRC

Based off of ColorChord 2.


## TODO

  * Improve rolloff function in Phase 1, to prevent messy values based off of frequency and phase offset of the incoming signal.
  * Phase 2 needs to mark notes if they jump to another note by merging so that subsequent passes can track that note jumping to stay consistent.
