# shadertrixx

CNLohr's repo for his Unity assets and other shader notes surrounding VRChat.  This largely contains stuff made by other people but I have kind of collected.

## The most important trick

```hlsl
#define glsl_mod(x,y) (((x)-(y)*floor((x)/(y)))) 
```

Thanks, @d4rkpl4y3r - this originally actually comes from an epic bgolus forum post: https://forum.unity.com/threads/translating-a-glsl-shader-noise-algorithm-to-hlsl-cg.485750/


## Additional tricks

From @Lyuma
 * [flatten] (UNITY_FLATTEN macro) to force both cases of an if statement or
 * force a branch with [branch] (UNITY_BRANCH macro);
 * force loop to unroll with [unroll] (UNITY_UNROLL) or
 * force a loop with [loop] (UNITY_LOOP)
 * there's also [call] for if or switch statements I think, not sure exactly how it works.

From @Orels
 * Here's a pretty quick reference for HLSL: https://developer.download.nvidia.com/cg/index_stdlib.html

From @lox9973
 * This flowchart of how mono behaviors are executed and in what order: https://docs.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/monobehaviour_flowchart.svg

## tanoise

Very efficient noise based on Toocanzs noise. https://github.com/cnlohr/shadertrixx/blob/main/Assets/tanoise/README.md

## scrn_aurora

tanoise-modified aurora, originally written by nimitz, modified further by scrn.  https://github.com/cnlohr/shadertrixx/tree/main/Assets/scrn_aurora

## MRT

This demo is not in this project, but, I wanted to include notes on how to do multiple rendertextures.

1) Set up cameras pointed at whatever you want to compute.
2) Put the things on the mirrorreflection layer
3) Cull in camrea based on that layer.
4) Put camera on default layer.
5) Don't care about depth because when using MRTs, you want to avoid letting unity figure out the render order, unless you really don't care.
6) I find putting camera calcs on `UiMenu` to work best.

NOTE: Unfortunately, Unity messes up ordering of cameras.  You will need to explicitly execute the order you want for all the cameras.   You can only do this in `Update` or `LateUpdate`, i.e.

```cs
		CamCalcA.enabled = false;
		RenderBuffer[] renderBuffersA = new RenderBuffer[] { rtPositionA.colorBuffer, rtVelocityA.colorBuffer };
		CamCalcA.SetTargetBuffers(renderBuffersA, rtPositionA.depthBuffer);
```

     float depth = CorrectedLinearEyeDepth(sceneZ, direction.w);

     //Convert from Corrected Linear Eye Depth to Raw Depth 
     //Credit: https://www.cyanilux.com/tutorials/depth/#eye-depth

     depth = (1.0 - (depth * _ZBufferParams.w)) / (depth * _ZBufferParams.z);

Thanks, error.mdl for telling me how to disable batching.  This fixes issues where shaders need to get access to their local coordinates.

## HALP The Unity compiler is emitting really bizarre assembly code.

Eh, just try using a different shader model, add a 
```glsl
#pragma  target 5.0
```
in your code or something.  Heck 5.0's been supported since the GeForce 400 in 2010.

## Udon events.

Re: `FixedUpdate`, `Update`, `LateUpdate`

From Merlin: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html most of the events under Messages, with some exceptions like awake and things that don't make sense like the Unity networking related ones
you can look at what events UdonBehaviour.cs registers to see if they are actually there on Udon's side

## Getting big buffers

From @lox9973

BIG WARNING: After a lot of testing, we've found that this is slower than reading from a texture if doing intensive reads.  If you need to read from like 100 of these in a shader, probably best to move it into a texture first.

```c
cbuffer SampleBuffer {
    float _Samples[1023*4] : packoffset(c0);  
    float _Samples0[1023] : packoffset(c0);
    float _Samples1[1023] : packoffset(c1023);
    float _Samples2[1023] : packoffset(c2046);
    float _Samples3[1023] : packoffset(c3069);
};
float frag(float2 texcoord : TEXCOORD0) : SV_Target {
    uint k = floor(texcoord.x * _CustomRenderTextureInfo.x);
    float sum = 0;
    for(uint i=k; i<4092; i++)
        sum += _Samples[i] * _Samples[i-k];
    if(texcoord.x < 0)
        sum = _Samples0[0] + _Samples1[0] + _Samples2[0] + _Samples3[0]; // slick
    return sum;
}
```
and
```c
void Update() {
    source.GetOutputData(samples, 0);
    System.Array.Copy(samples, 4096-1023*4, samples0, 0, 1023);
    System.Array.Copy(samples, 4096-1023*3, samples1, 0, 1023);
    System.Array.Copy(samples, 4096-1023*2, samples2, 0, 1023);
    System.Array.Copy(samples, 4096-1023*1, samples3, 0, 1023);
    target.SetFloatArray("_Samples0", samples0);
    target.SetFloatArray("_Samples1", samples1);
    target.SetFloatArray("_Samples2", samples2);
    target.SetFloatArray("_Samples3", samples3);
}

## CRT Perf Testing
Test number results were performed on a laptop RTX2070.

**BIG NOTE**: CNLohr has observed lots of oddities and breaking things when you use the "period" functionality in CRTs.  I strongly recommend setting "period" to 0.

NSIGHT Tests were not performed in VR.

SINGLE CRT TESTS

Swapping buffers between passes:

 * SAME CRT: 1024x1024 RGBAF Running a CRT with with 25x .2x.2 update zones, double buffering every time yields a total run time of 
   * 2.25ms in-editor. 2.5ms in-game.
   * Each pass executed over a 10us window.
   * There was 100us between executions.
 * Same as above, except for 128x128.
   * 330us in-editor. 250us in-game.
   * Each pass executed over a 6us window.
   * There was 6us between executions.
 * Same as above, except for 20x20.
   * 340us in-editor. 270us in-game.
   * Each pass executed over a 6us window.
   * There was 6us between executions.
   
Not swapping buffers between passes:

 * SAME CRT: 1024x1024 RGBAF Running a CRT with with 25x .2x.2 update zones, double buffering only on last pass yields a total run time of 
   * 230-280us in-editor. 185us in-game.
   * Each pass executed over a 3.5us window.
   * There is no time between executions.
   * There was a 100us lag on the very last update.
 * Same as above, except for 128x128.
   * 63us in-editor. 22us (+/- a fair bit) in-game.
   * Each pass executed over a between 400ns and 1us window.
   * There are random lags surrounding this in game, but the lags are all tiny.
   
   
With chained CRTs, **but** using the same shader.  The mateials were set up so that each passing CRT.  All tests run 25 separate CRTs, using the last one.
 * 1024x1024 RGBAF running a CRT, but only .2x.2 of the update zone. (So it's a fair test).
   * ~80us in-editor, 140us in-game.
   * ~6.5us between passes.
   * First material uses a fixed material.
   * OBSERVATION: This looks cheaty, as it's all the same rendertarget.
 * Same, except forces the chain to be circular.
   * Same in-game perf.
 * Same, except verifying that each step is not stepped upon.
   * Unity a little slower (110us), 160us in-game.

 * Forced different rendertarget sizes, pinging between 1024x1024 and 512x512.
   * ~85us in-editor.
   * 120us in-game.

 * Forcefully inserting one double-buffered frame, to allow data tobe fed back in on itself
    * 190us in-editor
	* 250us in-game.
	* The frame with the double buffer incurs a huge pipeline hit of ~110us.

### Cameras
 * Created 25 cameras, pointed at 25 quads, each on an invisible layer.
 * No depth buffer, no clear.
 * Quad was only .2x.2
 * Basically same shader as chain CRT.
 * 1024x1024 RGBA32F
 
 * In-Editor 234us per camera. 5.8ms total.
 * In-Game 300us per camera. 7.8ms total.

Trying 128x128
 * In-Editor: 35us per camera. around 600us total.
 * In-game: ~30us per camera.  But, weird timing. Has stalls. Takes ~2.1ms total.

### Conclusions:
 * You can work with large CRTs that chain with virtually no overhead.
 * Small (say 128x128) buffers can double buffer almost instantly.
 * Larger buffers, for instance 1024x1024 RGBA32F take ~110us to double-buffer.
 * No penalty is paid by chaining CRTs target different texture sizes.
 * Note that all tests were performed with the same shader for all CRTs.
 * Cameras work surprisingly well for smaller textures and really poorly for big textures.
